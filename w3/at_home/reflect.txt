
1) In our program the size of each C-style character string is max_name_lenght (40 characters) + 1. This +1 is because we need allocate space for the special character 'null terminator' (\0) which is used to indicate the end of the string.

2) Because C++ allows overload functions, functions with same name and diferent meanings. C++ refers to functions first and foremost by their identifier and distinguishes different meanings by differing parameter lists.

3) This workshop i learned how to use overload functions, understand more about dinamyc memory and their initialization and how to print the amount of two digits from a varaiable.


	QUIZ 2 REFLECTION

1) Queries are the accessor methods, which report the state of the object.
Modifiers are the mutator methods, which change the state of the object. 
So the difference between them is, a query only show the state of the object without change it, and a modifier change the state.

2) Constructors are a mechanism for initializing data members at creation-time. 

3) Destructors are a mechanism for tidying up at the end of an object's lifetime.  An object with dynamically allocated memory needs to deallocate that memory before going out of scope.

4) If we don't declare a constructor in the class definition, the compiler inserts a default no-argument constructor with an empty body, but if the class definition includes the prototype for a constructor with some parameters but does not include the prototype for a no-argument default constructor, the compiler does not insert an empty-body, no-argument default constructor.
