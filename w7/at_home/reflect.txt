1) No, the Hero class doesnt need to know about the SuperHero class because
it is the base class, it is in top of hierarchy and the SuperHero class is a class derived from it.
The base class only contains the instance variables of the base class.

2) Yes, the SuperHero class os derived from the Hero class. It contains the instance variables
of the base class and those of the derived class.

variables of the base class.

4)Yes, both are valid becase the overload operator returns a valid class.
