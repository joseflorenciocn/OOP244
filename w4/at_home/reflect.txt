1) To avoid undefined behavior or broken objects, we need to initialize each object to a well-defined state from the time of its creation. This state is called Safe Empty State.
If we use constructors to initialize the object with some valuable data (not empty) it will be another safe state as the empty safe state.

2) Using functions to do one action regurlary used inside the code. For example to set all the elements to empty, I create one function to set every element to empty, so when I need set to empty state i call the fucntion.

3) Because the function is passing by reference or Alias. When we use the reference of the object we have acess to the object.

4) I dont use strncpy. I used strcpy and add _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS at preprocessor definition. But if I used strncpy, I need to add the number of characters of the string.  

5) The use of constructors and destructors.

Quiz Reflection.

1) A class when you need to use the binary arithmetic, assignment, unary, relational. For example a class made by students and we need to add one extra grade to the object.
Overload operators are functions that add new features to the regular operators for use with the class members.

2) Unary: ++ or --operator
Binary: + or - or * or / operator
Ternary: ?: operator

3) Using the keyword THIS
