1) Namespace is a scope for the entities that it encloses. 
The purpose is organize the code into groups.

2) The programs often need to use functions defined in one place, it could be inside the .cpp, but
using the header files we can compile the programs without need the function definition inside .cpp
and the program will be more organized.

3) Header files contains only declarations, compiling them it will not achieve anything useful.

4) We will never include the .cpp files because the include is just a link to combine
the files, if someone include a .cpp file and this file is big the time to compile
will be colossal.

5) I learned in this workshop how to organize my program in files (.h and .cpp), how can I
protect my code to avoid call multiple times the same header, and how namespace can be used.
