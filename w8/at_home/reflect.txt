1) An abstract class is a base class that defines an interface, 
while a concrete class is a derived class that implements that interface.  
The abstract class identifies the member functions that the class hierarchy 
exposes to its clients and is the gateway to testing the derived classes in 
its own inheritance hierarchy.  Each concrete class gives a specific meaning 
to the interface.

2) The credit and debit function is shadowing from iAccount by Account and ChequingAccount,
 The monthEnd and display function is shadowing from iAccount by SavingsAccount and ChequingAccount
and CreateAccount function is shadowing form iAccount by Allocator.

3) I have learn in this workshop how to use multiples files and derived classes 
from the base class, shadow functions and pointers to a class. 
Also, how to refine my output using precision.
